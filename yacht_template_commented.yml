image: dev/application:latest
#Required This is the image that's pulled from dockerhub. The tag (:latest) is optional.

categories:
- Other
- Tools
#A list of categories associated with the application. This is optional but sorting/filtering by category will eventually be a feature.
platform: linux
#The platform the image will run on.
restart_policy: unless-stopped

ports:
- WebUI: 9091:9091/tcp
- HTTPS: 9090:9090/tcp
#Ports to be passed through. The host port is on the left of the : and the container port is on the right. Protocol is after the /. If no host port is specified a random one is used. You can label ports for the services that are on them. This will auto-fill the label field in the deploy form and give users a better understanding of the applications they're running.
network_mode: bridge
#You can set a certain network mode if you're using a legacy application that requires it. any ports mapped will not be passed through if you choose host as your networking mode and you cannot change the ports.
volumes:
- container: "/data"
  bind: "!downloads"
- container: "/etc/localtime"
  bind: "!localtime"
#List of bind mounts. Container will mount inside of the container and bind will mount on the host. The bind section can utilize Template Variables in the users settings so if they're set they'll be replaced by what's there. You can use a named volume by using the name of the volume instead of a path (no / at the beginning).
sysctls:
- net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6: '0'
#Key value pair for sysctl options.
cap_add:
- NET_ADMIN

- name: EnvWithDescription
  label: EnvWithDescription
  description: This is a description
  default: default
#Env is used to set environment variables within the docker container. The description and default are both optional. Label currently isn't used but will be what is shown as the name of the field in the deploy form.
labels:
- label: local.yacht.label
  value: this is a label
- label: local.yacht.otherlabel
  value: this is another label
#Labels can be used for automating services like traefik automatically as well as store information about containers (this is where port descriptions are stored on containers). These will show up in the advanced section like sysctls and capabilities.
devices:
- host: /dev/null
  container: /dev/null
#Devices allow devices to be passed through containers for things like transcoding.
